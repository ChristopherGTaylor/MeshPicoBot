# MeshPicoBot
Meshstatic Chatbot for a Pico Wireless with Lora module
To run a listener/server on a Pico Wireless with a LoRa module to handle incoming messages and respond with sensor data, you'll need to follow several steps. Here's a basic outline of what you'll need to do:

1. **Set up the hardware:**
   - Connect the LoRa module to your Raspberry Pi Pico. Make sure it's properly wired according to the specifications of your LoRa module.
   - Connect any sensors you want to monitor to your Raspberry Pi Pico as well.

2. **Install necessary software:**
   - You'll need to use a MicroPython environment on your Raspberry Pi Pico. Make sure it's set up and running properly.
   - Install the necessary libraries for LoRa communication and any other sensors you're using. These libraries will vary depending on the specific hardware you're using.

3. **Write the code:**
   - Write Python code to set up a listener/server on your Raspberry Pi Pico. This code will listen for incoming messages from the LoRa module.
   - Parse the incoming messages to identify the specific pattern you're looking for (e.g., commands or requests).
   - Depending on the pattern identified, gather sensor data from the connected sensors.
   - Craft a response message containing the requested sensor data.
   - Send the response message back using the LoRa module.

4. **Test and iterate:**
   - Test your code thoroughly to ensure that it correctly handles incoming messages and responds with the appropriate sensor data.
   - Iterate on your code as needed to improve functionality and performance.

Here's a very basic example code snippet to give you an idea of how you might implement this:

```python
import machine
from network import LoRa
import socket
import time

# Initialize LoRa in LORA mode
lora = LoRa(mode=LoRa.LORA)

# Create a raw LoRa socket
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_LORA, socket.SOCK_RAW)

# Set the LoRa frequency
s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_LORA, socket.SO_DR, 5)  # Set data rate to 5 (for example)

# Set up sensor(s) here (e.g., import libraries, initialize sensors)

# Main loop
while True:
    # Wait for incoming message
    received_data = s.recv(64).decode('utf-8')

    # Check if the received message matches the pattern you're looking for
    if 'pattern' in received_data:
        # Collect sensor data
        # Replace these lines with code to read sensor data
        sensor_data = {
            'temperature': 25.5,
            'humidity': 50
        }
        
        # Craft response message with sensor data
        response = 'Sensor Data: Temperature - {:.1f} C, Humidity - {:.1f} %'.format(
            sensor_data['temperature'], sensor_data['humidity'])

        # Send response
        s.send(response.encode('utf-8'))

    # Delay before checking for messages again
    time.sleep(1)
```

Please note that this is just a basic example to get you started. You'll need to modify and expand upon this code to fit your specific requirements and hardware setup. Additionally, you'll need to handle error cases, implement more robust message parsing, and ensure that your code is efficient and reliable for use in a real-world application.
